			<h2>What is HTTP Trigger?</h2>
			<h3>
				FrontlineSMS is an extremely flexible messaging application, allowing incoming text messages 
				to trigger keyword events (auto replies, group joining, emailing, 
				message-posting to websites, and so on). Increasing numbers of users - 
				software developers in particular - have been trying to integrate their 
				own applications (which generate patient reminders, medical advice, 
				weather forecasts, and so on). HTTP Trigger allows these external programs 
				to pass text to FrontlineSMS, which is then sent out as a text message. 
				Please bear in mind that this is an <span class="highlight">advanced feature</span>
				of FrontlineSMS, and is generally reserved for experienced software developers.
			
				<span class="subtitle">How to set up a Trigger</span>
				The HTTP Trigger function is designed to allow the passing of HTTP commands to FrontlineSMS by using 
				a mutually configured blank HTTP port. Currently FrontlineSMS only 
				supports the <u>sending</u> of SMS; although, this may change in the future. 
				To set up a HTTP Trigger, choose a free port number and enter it into the
				<span class="highlight">Port</span> field <span class="reference">2</span>. 
				Click on the <span class="feature">Start</span>
				button to begin monitoring the port. All events will be displayed in the main window
				<span class="reference">1</span>.

				This diagram gives an example of an application checking for website updates (e.g. an RSS feed). 
				When the application detects that a new feed has occurred, it uses a HTTP 
				request to communicate with FrontlineSMS in the following format:
				
				<span class="cleared">http://localhost:&lt;portNumber&gt;/send/sms/&lt;destinationPhoneNumber&gt;/&lt;messageContent&gt;/</span>
				
				Where &lt;portNumber&gt; is the free port, &lt;destinationPhoneNumber&gt; is the 
				number to send the message to, and &lt;messageContent&gt; is the content of the 
				message. All values should be URL-encoded.
