			<h1>SMS Internet Service Settings</h1>
			<h4>
				Although FrontlineSMS was originally developed to allow group text messaging in places where there 
				wasn't internet access, more recent versions allow messages to be sent 
				through the internet if and when it is available. Messages sent this way 
				are generally much faster and cheaper than sending through an attached 
				mobile phone or modem, but you do need to set up an account and buy messages 
				up-front using a credit card.  FrontlineSMS currently comes with support for the
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.clickatell.com">Clickatell</a> and
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.intellisms.co.uk">IntelliSMS</a>
				messaging services. Both providers offer similar services, but Clickatell has a slightly more 
				complicated set-up and sign-up procedure. Novice users are recommended to try IntelliSMS 
				first, although you can use both at the same time if you want 
				to try them both.
				To start, click on <span class="feature">SMS Internet Service 
				Settings</span> in the <span class="feature">Settings</span>
				menu. If you have existing accounts set-up in FrontlineSMS, they will 
				appear on the next screen. If you have no accounts set-up yet, click
				<span class="feature">New</span> on the screen to give you an option to set-up a Clickatell or IntelliSMS 
				account. You now need to sign-up for the service of your choice.
				<span class="note">
					You will need to be connected to the Internet to register for either of these services
				</span>
			</h4>				
			
				
			<h2>IntelliSMS</h2>
			<h3>
				To use IntelliSMS you need to <span class="highlight">sign-up for an account</span> on the IntelliSMS 
				website. Once you have your user details you simply enter your username, 
				password and the mobile number you used to register with the service - 
				which should ideally be the number you plan to use in your FrontlineSMS 
				system - into 
				the <span class="highlight">IntelliSMS Account Configuration</span>
				screen, below.
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image">
					<img border="0" src="img/settings-intellismssettings.jpg" vspace="4" width="400" height="310">
				</div>
				
				If you want to also be able to <u>receive</u> text messages through the IntelliSMS service - a helpful 
				option if you don't have a phone or modem to attach to your computer - you 
				need to edit your &quot;<span class="highlight">My Account -&gt; 
				Preferences</span>&quot; options on the IntelliSMS website, adding your email address and setting 
				the <span class="emphase">Forwarding type</span> to <span class="special">Email</span> (see below).
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image"><img border="1" src="img/intellismsweb.jpg" vspace="4" width="400" height="377"></div>
				
				To finish, you now need to tell FrontlineSMS you want to receive messages via the service, and input 
				your email account settings. You may need to consult 
				your email service provider, or their website, to get some of this 
				information, which needs to be added to the fields below in the <span class="highlight">IntelliSMS Account Configuration</span> 
				screen. Tick the <span class="highlight">Use for receiving</span>box and enter your information (see example below).
				
				<span class="tip">
					It is recommended that you create a separate and dedicated email address for 
					this service, and not use your personal email address.
				</span>
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image"><img border="0" src="img/intellisms-email.jpg" vspace="4" width="273" height="211"></div>
				
				You should now be ready to go! If you have any problems, consult the
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.intellisms.co.uk/sms-solutions/support/">
				<span class="feature">Help pages</span></a> on the IntelliSMS website.

			<h2>Clickatell</h2>
			<h3>
				To use Clickatell you need to set up your own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clickatell.com/developers/api_http.php">
				Clickatell API Account</a> (select the <span class="highlight">HTTP/HTTPS</span> option on the sign-up screen).
				Once you have registered for the service you need to input your username, API number, password and the 
				mobile number you registered with Clickatell into the <span class="highlight">Clickatell Account Configuration</span>
				screen below. As soon as you have entered your details, assuming you remain connected to the Internet, you should see your Clickatell 
				connection show as a <span class="highlight">HTTP</span> connection on the FrontlineSMS
				<a href="phones.htm">Phones</a> screen</font></p>
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image"><img border="0" src="img/settings-clickatellsettings.jpg" vspace="4" width="338" height="228"></div>
				
				<span class="tip">
					Messages can be sent out via Clickatell, but you can divert any replies to a local 
					phone attached to your computer, and FrontlineSMS. If you insert a mobile 
					phone number in the <span class="feature">Sender Number</span>
					field, when users hit &quot;Reply&quot; on their phones, their message will come 
					directly back to you, and not Clickatell. Please note that all
					<span class="feature">Sender Numbers</span> need to be approved by Clickatell, who need to verify that the number 
					belongs to you. Check out this <a target="_blank" href="http://support.clickatell.com/faq.php?mode=view_entry&kbid=150&kbcat=22">
					Clickatell Help</a> page for details.<br/><br/>
					When using Clickatell you can also pass your organisation name along with the message, so it 
					displays on the recipient's screen as, for example, &quot;From: FrontlineSMS&quot;. 
					This might be helpful if there are issues of trust, and your recipient 
					might be wary of the authenticity of a message coming from a number they 
					don't recognise. To do this you need to set an alphanumeric sender ID in 
					Clickatell, who need to approve it first. Once approved you can type in 
					the approved text in the <span class="feature">Sender Number</span> field in FrontlineSMS (as above). Check out this
					<a target="_blank" href="http://support.clickatell.com/faq.php?mode=view_entry&kbid=150&kbcat=22">
					Clickatell Help</a> page for details.

				<span class="note">You cannot set both a reply number and an alphanumeric name at the same time</span>
