      <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Before you dig any deeper into 
      the FrontlineSMS troubleshooting section, check the following which may 
      help you quickly resolve your problem</span></font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699">Handset</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699"><b><br>
      </b>Are you using a Symbian phone (for example, a Nokia N-series phone), a 
      Windows Mobile phone, a Blackberry or an iPhone? If you are, FrontlineSMS 
      does not currently support these generally higher-end devices. We plan to 
      include support for these phones in future releases. <i>Try and source an 
      alternative phone</i></font>.</p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699">Cable</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699"><b><br>
      </b>Are you using the correct cable for your phone? Many cables will fit 
      phones they are not intended for, and using the wrong cable (or a cheap 
      import) can cause your computer to not recognise your device. <i>Check 
      your phone manufacturer's website for further information, or see if your 
      phone and laptop supports Bluetooth, in which case you will be able to 
      connect without a cable</i></font>.</p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699">Driver</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699"><b><br>
      </b>Have you installed a driver for your phone? Drivers tell your computer 
      how to handle your phone. A missing driver, or a corrupt or invalid 
      driver, will cause your computer to either not properly recognise your 
      phone, or cause it to fail to properly connect. <i>Check your phone 
      manufacturer's website for further details or, if your phone came with a 
      CD, look there for installation instructions</i></font>.</p>
      <p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699"><b>Software<br>
      </b>Some software programs, which come on a CD with your phone, block other 
      applications, like FrontlineSMS, from accessing the phone. If you have 
      installed Nokia PC Suite, or any other phone management/handset management 
      software from a CD, close this program and try running FrontlineSMS again. 
      You may have to also check that the program does not continue to run in 
      the background - if it is you will usually see a small icon, usually 
      towards the bottom right of your screen by the clock on Windows machines.
      <i>If you see one, right-click on the icon and select &quot;Close&quot; or &quot;Exit&quot; 
      and try running FrontlineSMS again</i></font>.</p>

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699"><b>Port<br>
      </b>This is the communications (COM) port which your computer assigns to 
      your phone or modem when you plug it in (for example, COM1, COM2 and so 
      on). FrontlineSMS automatically searches through all your COM ports, but 
      if for some reason it does not find your phone there, and you know which 
      port it is connected to, you can select it here</font>.</p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699">Baud Rate<br>
      </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699">This is the speed 
      at which FrontlineSMS communicates with your phone or modem. Again, during 
      the scan of your computer, FrontlineSMS tries talking to your phone at 
      different speeds. Once it ascertains the highest speed that your phone can 
      work at, it fully connects with it at that speed. If for some reason 
      FrontlineSMS is unable to communicate at the right speed, your phone may 
      not work. If you know the speed at which your phone communicates, you can 
      select it here</font>.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699"><b>Handler<br>
      </b>FrontlineSMS uses <i>&quot;handlers&quot;</i> to talk with your phone. If it is 
      unable to figure out what kind of phone you have, it may assign the wrong 
      handler. To help alleviate this, the </font><b>
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#111111">Handler</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#336699">

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#666666">Because of the huge number 
      of phones in the marketplace, FrontlineSMS is unable to support each and 
      every one. Some phones are designed and built differently to others, and 
      in some cases these subtle differences will stop FrontlineSMS from 
      successfully communicating. These differences can also exist in phones 
      made by the same manufacturer. For example, the Nokia 1100 uses different 
      mobile-to-PC communications techniques to the Nokia 6100</font>.</p>
