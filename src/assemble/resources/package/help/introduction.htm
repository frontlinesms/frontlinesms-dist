			<h1>Introduction to FrontlineSMS</h1>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<h3>
				<span class="highlight">FrontlineSMS</span> was the first text messaging system to be conceived, designed and written 
				firmly with the needs of the non-profit sector in mind. Until its release 
				in 2005, a 
				majority of systems did not taken into account the nature of non-profit 
				work, and the specific conditions (financial and physical) which many NGOs 
				work under. The FrontlineSMS software is provided <span class="highlight">free</span> to charities 
				and other non-profit organisations. FrontlineSMS has been successfully 
				deployed in over fifty countries in many areas by grassroots NGOs 
				including the Nigerian and Philippine elections, in the sending of 
				security alerts to fieldworkers in Afghanistan, market prices to 
				smallholder farmers in Aceh, El Salvador and Cambodia, and to circumvent government restrictions in 
				countries including Zimbabwe and Pakistan. You can hear directly from a 
				growing number of FrontlineSMS users through our
				<a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/blog">Guest Blog</a> and online
				<a href="http://frontlinesms.ning.com">Community</a>.
			</h3>
			<h4>
				So, what is FrontlineSMS? Well, FrontlineSMS 
				turns a laptop - or desktop - computer and a mobile phone or modem into a 
				two-way group messaging hub (see image, above). Since it works anywhere 
				there's a mobile signal, it doesn't need the Internet, a major advantage 
				for many grassroots NGOs. Once you have the software running on your 
				computer, you can send messages to wide groups of people, and collect 
				responses to any questions or surveys you might want to run, all via text 
				message.
			</h4>
			<h3>
				The FrontlineSMS success story has been cited in numerous NGO and industry 
				research papers, websites, news sites and publications since its launch in 
				2005. It was short listed in the Mobile Messaging Awards 2007, named WSIS 
				&quot;ICT Success Story of the Month&quot; for its use in monitoring the Nigerian 
				elections, was a finalist in the Stockholm Challenge 2008 and won a 
				prestigious Silicon Valley &quot;Tech Award&quot; in 2009.
			</h3>
			<h3>
				In the first four years since its release, FrontlineSMS has been used by NGOs for a wide range of activities including blood donor 
				recruitment and assisting human rights workers, to promoting government 
				accountability, keeping medical students informed about education options, 
				providing security alerts to field workers, election monitoring, the 
				capture and exchange of vegetable (and coffee) price information, the 
				distribution of weather forecasts, the co-ordination of healthcare 
				workers, the organising of political demonstrations, the carrying out of 
				surveys and the reporting and monitoring of disease outbreaks. The uses 
				are endless.
			<h3>
			
			
			<h2>What can FrontlineSMS do for me?</h2>
			<h3>
				Are you a locally, or 
				internationally, based NGO looking at the potential to use mobile phone 
				text messages to reach specific groups of individuals within a target 
				community? Or to run an awareness raising campaign? Or to run a 
				competition, or carry out a text-based survey? Or to simply keep in touch 
				with your fieldworkers or staff?
			</h3>
			<h3>
				If you have already identified applications for text messaging within your 
				organisation and are looking for a simple, comprehensive, affordable and 
				complete entry-level system then you're in the right place. If you think 
				text messaging could work for you but don't know where to start, and are 
				looking to try a service without having to dig too deep into your pockets, 
				then you're also in the right place.

			<h2>Who is behind FrontlineSMS?</h2>
			<h3>
				The FrontlineSMS concept was developed by <span class="highlight"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kiwanja.net">
				kiwanja.net</a></span> in early 2005, and the first version released later in the same year.
				Since 2003, kiwanja.net has been  helping local, national and international non-profit organisations make 
				better use of information and communications technology in their work. 
				Specialising in the application of mobile technology, it provides a wide 
				range of ICT-related services drawing on over 25 years experience of its 
				founder, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kiwanja.net/kenbanks.htm">
				Ken Banks</a>.

				The initial rebuild of FrontlineSMS was kindly funded by the
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.macfound.org">
				MacArthur Foundation</a> in 2007 and 
				the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hewlett.org">
				Hewlett Foundation</a> in 2009. The
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.soros.org">Open 
				Society Institute</a> and
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hivos.nl/english">
				HIVOS</a> provided follow-on funding during 
				the open sourcing phase, which also helped us build and grow the user community. 
				In 2010, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockfound.org">
				Rockefeller Foundation</a> 
				and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omidyar.com">
				Omidyar Network</a> came on board and 
				provided further development funding. Programming and software development 
				has been carried out by 
				Alex and Morgan at FrontlineSMS HQ, with earlier support from Ben, Kadu and Tom at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masabi.com">
				Masabi</a>. The FrontlineSMS website was 
				crafted by a team lead by Margaret and Marcelino - ably directed by Renny 
				- at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wk.com">
				Wieden+Kennedy</a>.
