			<h2>What can I do in Keywords?</h2>
			<h3>
				<span class="highlight">Keywords</span> is an extremely powerful module which allows you to automatically trigger actions 
				within FrontlineSMS. This section of FrontlineSMS Help will guide you through the features in the 
				<span class="feature">Keywords</span> module. Please take your time - there's a lot here.
			</h3>
				
			<h2>Keyword actions</h2>
			<h3>
				Keywords are simply predefined words which, when users or members of the public include in their texts, 
				cause FrontlineSMS to carry out a specific action. This action can be one of several things 
				<span class="highlight emphase">(click on a type for more info)</span>:
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="keywordActions/autoreply.htm"><span class="highlight keywordlink">Auto Reply</span></a>
						<ul>
							<li>FrontlineSMS will automatically send a pre-determined SMS back to the sender
							of the keyword/message (maybe a "<span class="emphase">Thank you for your message</span>", for example)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="keywordActions/autoforward.htm"><span class="highlight keywordlink">Auto Forward</span></a>
						<ul>
							<li>FrontlineSMS will automatically forward the incoming message to all members 
							of a pre-determined Group. This can be useful when you want Group members to be
							able to contact each other via SMS with the latest news, or urgent announcements. 
							(<span class="feature">Auto Forward</span> does a similar thing to <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>,
							which you may have heard of).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="keywordActions/join_leave.htm"><span class="highlight keywordlink">Join Group</span></a>
						<ul>
							<li>FrontlineSMS will automatically add the person who sent the SMS to a pre-determined Group.
							Again, this is useful if you are running a series of user Groups or clubs, and want people to be
							able to join automatically by publicising the keyword without them having to contact you directly.
							A campaign, for example, could say "<span class="emphase">To join our Control Arms Campaign, 
							text in the word JOIN to 650123456</span>". Here, <span class="highlight">JOIN</span> is the keyword.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="keywordActions/join_leave.htm"><span class="highlight keywordlink">Leave Group</span></a>
						<ul>
							<li>Members of Groups can leave any time they like by sending an SMS with a pre-determined keyword or phrase 
							(for example, <span class="highlight">LEAVE GROUP</span>)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="keywordActions/emails.htm"><span class="highlight keywordlink">E-mail</span></a>
						<ul>
							<li>Keywords can be used to instruct FrontlineSMS to automatically forward an incoming text message
							to a pre-determined recipient, by email. This might be useful if you want a Project Manager, or someone
							in a different country or office, to receive (free) email notifications of incoming survey or campaign
							text messages, or if you'd like some of your text messages to be backed up in an email system such as
							Google Mail or Hotmail.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="keywordActions/externalcommand.htm"><span class="highlight keywordlink">External Command</span></a>
						<ul>
							<li>Although a particularly advanced feature, and one most likely to be used by more technical users,
							keywords can be set up to trigger the running of external commands or programs (for example, a batch file or a script).
							For example, a batch file could be written which finds out how much free disk space is left on the computer.
							An incoming SMS with, say, the keywords <span class="highlight">FREE SPACE</span> could then be set to trigger the running of this batch file,
							with FrontlineSMS texting the result (i.e. the amount of free disk space) back to the message sender.
							The <span class="feature">External Command</span> function can also be used to instruct FrontlineSMS to send incoming messages to remote 
							servers over the internet (using <span class="emphase">HTTP GET</span>), which may be useful as a method of backing up data, or for a website
							with a news ticker which needs to display all incoming messages for a campaign or event</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				Keywords can also be set to have multiple actions. So, for example, the Keyword <span class="highlight">JOIN</span>
				could be set to allow people to remotely <span class="highlight">Join Groups</span>, and to also  
				<span class="feature">Auto Reply</span> to the message sender with a "<span class="emphase">Thank you for joining our Group.
				We will be in touch</span>" message. If you really wanted to, you could also set the <span class="highlight">JOIN</span> Keyword 
				to <span class="feature">Auto Forward</span> the joining message to all other members of the Group, in case you wanted them all 
				to know that there was a new member. There is no limit to the number of actions that can be set for a Keyword.
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Using the &lt;None&gt; and &lt;MMS&gt; keywords</h2>
			<h3>
				When you start FrontlineSMS for the first time, you will notice two entries - &lt;None&gt; and &lt;MMS&gt; - in the main
				<span class="highlight">Keyword</span> window <span class="reference">1</span>. If you want <u>every incoming SMS which 
				doesn't match any other keyword</u> to trigger an action - perhaps a thank you message - regardless of message content, 
				then use the &lt;None&gt; keyword entry. You can use &lt;None&gt; to forward every incoming message to a website, 
				or to services such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> or 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, for example.
				If you would like to trigger actions everytime a <span class="feature">Multimedia Message</span> is received,
				use the &lt;MMS&gt; keyword.
				<span class="note">
					For <span class="feature">Multimedia messages</span>, the date taken into account for keyword actions is the actual date of reception,
					and not the date FrontlineSMS picked the message.
				</span>
			</h3>
				
			<h2>Adding a new Keyword</h2>
			<h3>
				All current FrontlineSMS keywords appear in the main <span class="feature">Keyword</span> window <span class="reference">1</span>. 
				To add a new Keyword, click on <span class="highlight">New</span><span class="reference">5</span> and enter a name 
				(and a description, if you need one - this is not essential). Your keyword will then appear in the main window <span class="reference">1</span>.
				After highlighting the new keyword you can edit any of the fields to the right <span class="reference">2</span>.
				See below for the various options.
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Adding actions in the &quot;Simple View&quot;</h2>
			<span class="subtitle">Adding an &quot;Auto Reply&quot; action</span>
			<h3>
				If you want an automatic message to be sent back to the message sender (perhaps a 
				"<span class="emphase">Thank you for contacting us</span>" message, or similar), tick the check box and type this message in
				the "<span class="emphase">Send this message as an auto reply</span>" field <span class="reference">2</span>.
			</h3>
				
			<span class="subtitle">Adding a &quot;Join Group&quot; action</span>
			<h3>
				If you want this keyword to automatically instruct FrontlineSMS to add the sender of the message to a specific Group,
				select the Group name from the list under "<span class="emphase">Add message sender to group</span>"
				<span class="reference">2</span>.
			</h3>
			
			<span class="subtitle">Adding a &quot;Leave Group&quot; action</span>
			<h3>
				If you want this keyword to automatically instruct FrontlineSMS to remove the sender of the message from a specific Group,
				select the Group name from the list under "<span class="emphase">Remove message sender from group</span>" 
				<span class="reference">2</span>. When you are finished adding these initial actions, click the <span class="highlight">Save</span>
				button <span class="reference">3</span>.

				<span class="note">
					When testing your keywords for the first time, bear in mind that it can take a couple of minutes for FrontlineSMS 
					to pick up the incoming text message, and a minute or two for the event to be triggered.
				</span>
				<span class="note">
					There are other Advanced keyword actions that can be set. See the section below for further details.
				</span>
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Adding further actions in the &quot;Advanced View&quot;</h2>
			<h3>
				If you'd like to add further actions to any of your Keywords, selecting the Keyword from the
				<span class="highlight">Keyword</span> window <span class="reference">1</span> brings up an additional menu function.
				<span class="reference">4</span>. Click on <font color="#00F">&quot;Click here to go to advanced view&quot;</font>
				to open up a new screen (below).
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image"><img border="0" src="img/keywords-advanced.jpg"></div>
				
				This &quot;<span class="emphase">advanced view</span>&quot; allows you to add additional actions to your Keyword.
				A list of available actions are listed in the pop-up menu <span class="reference">1</span>. 
				Select the new action which you'd like to add, and then click on the settings button <span class="reference">2</span>.
				A different dialogue box will appear next, depending on which action you select.
				
				<ul>
