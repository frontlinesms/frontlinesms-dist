			<h1>Multimedia Messages (MMS)</h1>
			<h4>
				From version <span class="highlight">1.6.15</span>, FrontlineSMS comes with a new <span class="feature">Multimedia messages</span>
				compatibility. In most countries, and for most mobile network operators, you can send an MMS message from a phone to a standard email account.
				 For now, FrontlineSMS can display the MMS received on these accounts (MMS sent to the connected device are not supported yet).
				 This help page will help you set up an E-mail account to allow FrontlineSMS to access the MMS received in your inbox.
			</h4>
			
			<h2>Structure of an MMS</h2>
			<h3>
				First of all, let's see what an actual MMS is.<br/>
				An MMS (Multimedia Message Service) is a type of message which extends the SMS capability. These are a way to send messages that include 
				multimedia content from phone to phone (and e-mail accounts). You can insert these kinds of content into a
				<span class="feature">Multimedia message</a>:
				<ul>
					<li>Text (like SMS)</li>
					<li>Pictures</li>
					<li>Videos</li>
					<li>Sounds</li>
				</ul>
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Configuring an MMS receiving e-mail account</h2>
			<h3>
				In order to receive your MMS, you will need a working e-mail account, and the settings required to establish a connection.
				Then open the <span class="feature">MMS Settings</span> dialog, and fill in all fields (see below).
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image"><img src="img/mms_configure.jpg"/></div>
				
				You can access your account with either the <span class="highlight">IMAP</span> or <span class="highlight">POP</span> protocols. 
				These are two ways of reaching your account, and some servers may not implement both protocols. When using <span class="highlight">POP</span>
				, your messages  will be extracted from the server, <span class="highlight">and deleted</span>. You can only access them once.
				
				<span class="tip">
					 If you're not familiar with all of this or if you're not sure what you are doing, we strongly recommend a connection via the
					<span class="highlight">IMAP</span> protocol.
				</span>
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Following the activity of your MMS e-mail accounts</h2>
			<h3>
				On the <a href="phones.htm">Phones</a> tab, you have access to all your communication services. This includes every modem,
				Internet service, and MMS e-mail account, connected or not. You now have a better idea of the status of each service (see below).
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image"><img src="img/mms_follow.jpg"/></div>
				
				<span class="tip">
					You can enable and disable MMS services at any moment by right-clicking on it and selecting
					<span class="highlight">Connect</span> or <span class="highlight">Disconnect</span>.
